# Class Code Generator (CCG)
Implemented in C++ (11) Class Code Generator (CCG) helps with creating, managing, scripting, and templating as needed for your development.  Aimed to work for developers of all kinds.

### GUI Planned Features
1.1.0 = build C# classes (non-partial) + C# interfaces, C structs, and Python (3.x) classes   
1.1.1 = build C++ classes, and C++ abstract (pure virtual methods [=0])    
1.1.2 = build common data structures, unit tests, import modules, and support plugin development for Xamarin-Android/iPhone/Windows

### Command Line Planned Features
1.2.0 = build C# classes (non-partial + partials) + interfaces, and Python (3.x) classes,  C++ classes, and C++ abstract (pure virtual methods [=0]), and C structs
1.2.1 = build Xamarin C# files for Android, iPhone, Windows devices, create plugins for Xamarin environment


## Command Line
The command line component of the application is the primary point of file and project management.  It also works (hand-in-hand) with the GUI as they both can take simlilar input, but the command line can manage more, better.  Valid commands and statements can also be written into a script and saved as a text file, then loaded into the command line to be parsed and executed (note: scripts will always inform the user with a confirmation message, whether or not the user has the 'confirm' command enabled).


## GUI
The GUI for the CCG application is designed for basic class specs as required per individual, or the requirements for a project.  In addition, the GUI can load any data into an XML document, or will unpack an XML document into the form elements on the GUI.  This means that the GUI can only handle one file manipulation at a time but offers more scope to change on a single file, whereas the command line component can take/handle multiple files and may require a bit of learning.
